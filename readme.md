# Support development

Are you wondering how you can support further development? Well, here's how!

- [Download the app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ihog-osc-lighting-remote/id1487580623?ls=1) - This is a one time fee with a small in app purchase to unlock a feature. There is also a way to tip in the app, but Apple will take 30% of that. Please also leave a rating and review on the App Store.
